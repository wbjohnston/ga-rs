# Genetic Programming Toolkit
Multi-paradigm library for genetic programming

Please read the [API documentation on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/ga)


_Note_: This project is currently a work in progress. If somehow you stumble
upon this library: you **should not** use this library as its incomplete and the
API is **not stable**.
